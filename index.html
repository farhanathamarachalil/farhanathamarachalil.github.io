One of the <i>oldest civilisations in the world</i>, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences.
With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist
destinations in the world.<BR> It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the 
snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th 
largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as
 it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity</p>

  <H4>THE LAND OF GANDHI</H4>
  <P>The legacy of <B><I>Mahatma Gandhi</I></B>, the Father of the Nation, is perfectly preserved in India. From various museums and memorials to Gandhiji's ashram, 
  there are various stopovers in the country that testify <BR>of the great life of the leader. His philosophies of truth and non-violence inspire millions
  and many people trace his footsteps by visiting the various monuments dedicated to him. Gandhiji's contribution to<BR> human development is far too great
  and varied to have been forgotten or overlooked. The world today recognises him as a far more compelling social innovator than humanity ever realised.</P>

  <H4>STATUE OF UNITY</H4>
 <P style="font-family:Times new roman">It’s huge, almost gigantic! That is the first reaction most people have as they speed down 
     the winding road leading to the towering Statue of Unity (SoU). A long bridge connects the
	 mainland to the Sadhu Bet<BR> Island, On which the statue stands. Silhouetted against the 
	 surrounding Vindhya and Satpura mountain ranges, the colossal statue almost seems to pierce 
	 the skyline.The legacy of<strong> <B>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</B>,<BR> <I>India’s Iron Man</I></STRONG>,
	 lives on in the form  of this massive statue dominating the Narmada river basin.</P>
